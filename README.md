# Surfs-Up-Weather-Analysis

## Overview

In this project we made an analysis of the temperature in Hawaii for the months of June and December as part of our goal to open a Surf and Shake shop serving surfboards and ice cream to locals and tourists in Oahu, Hawaii.
 
Using tools such as SQLite, SQLAlchemy, and Flask, also writing and executing Python code in a Jupyter notebook we wanted to determine if the surf shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results

We got the following results for the months of June and December about the temperature in Oahu:

## Summary

With this information we can draw the following conclusions: 

•	The variation in the average temperature is 4 degrees, even for the maximums we can observe that the difference is 3 degrees. 
•	The biggest difference is evident in the minimum temperatures, where it is observed that in December it can reach 56 degrees while in June to 64. 

From the above we can see that the difference in temperatures is not considerable and that it may be viable to keep the surf and ice cream store open throughout the year, however, before making definitive decisions we could make a couple of more analyzes that give us greater certainty for the opening of the store.

We made the following two queries: rainfall in the months of June and rainfall in the month of December to warn if it could influence the practice of surfing and that tourists are attracted to travel there in both months of the year. 

In the following image we can see the comparison of data between June and December on rainfall in the city of Oahu:
